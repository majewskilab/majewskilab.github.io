          <p class="paragraph paragraph-7"><span class="paragraph-text-7"><span class="paragraph-text-7" id="paragraph-text-1"><span class="paragraph-text-1">Several years ago, our group was involved in identifying mutations in histone genes, H3K27M and H3G34R, as frequent driver lesions in pediatric glioblastoma. Later, we found H3K36M mutations in sarcomas and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Mutation in histone genes have also been found in leukemias and bone tumors. Since those original discoveries, we have been using whole genome approaches to understand the molecular pathways through which “oncohistones” participate in carcinogenesis. This project is an international collaboration funded by the NIH, along with the labs of Dr. David Allis (Rockefeller, NY), Dr. Tom Muir (Princeton, NJ), Dr. Ben Garcia (UPenn, PA), Dr. Peter Lewis (Madison), and Dr. Nada Jabado (McGill). Our group focuses on the application of epigenome profiling techniques, such as ChIP seq and WGBS to identify epigenetic aberrations and RNA sequencing to connect them with their downstream transcriptomic consequences.

          <p class="paragraph paragraph-6"><span class="paragraph-text-8"><span class="paragraph-text-8" id="paragraph-text-2"><span class="paragraph-text-1">While rare, paediatric brain tumors are extremely deadly. Along with our collaborators, we have shown that the molecular mechanisms driving paediatric tumors are generally distinct from those underlying their adult equivalents. Most oncohistone mutations are unique to childhood cancers. The C19MC micro RNA cluster fusion is the unique driver of embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes. Ependymomas and medulloblastomas have their own sets of specific driver mutations, and they often affect the epigenome. This project, funded by Genome Canada and CIHR is a collaboration with Dr. Michael Taylor’s lab (Sick Kids, Toronto), Dr. Nada Jabado’s lab (McGill) and many bioinformatics and genomics experts across Canada. The project also contains drug development, ethics, health economics subcomponents. Our group is particularly interested in the dependencies between different epigenetic modifications, particularly those occurring at the H3K36 and H3K27 residues, and DNA methylation. We use genomics and analytical approaches in cell lines and mouse models to elucidate those interrelationships.

          <h2><span class="heading-text-3">3D Epigenomics</span>
          </h2>
          <p class="paragraph paragraph-4"><span class="paragraph-text-1">This project aims to bridge the gaps between the 1D and 3D genomic paradigms. Since the release of the first contiguous DNA genomic DNA sequences, towards the end of the last millennium, the ever-growing genomics community has largely considered the genome as a series of linear, 1-dimensional strings. As our knowledge and technologies mature, we are becoming increasingly aware that DNA is not a simple double stranded molecule, it is wrapped around a nucleosome core whose modifications impose specific flavours to its properties, and finally that this chromatin structure has a spatial, 3-dimensional component which further determines, or perhaps reflects the underlying molecular processes. In the recent years, this spatial paradigm has been brought to light by technologies such as Hi-C, which allow us to profile genome-wide patterns in chromatin architecture. While many “epigenomicists” are aware of the progress in the 3D field and are eager to incorporate this information in their work, it is not trivial to make a transition from the classical, 1D way of thinking to the 3D world. On the chromatin conformation side, while some methodological approaches have been accepted by the community, relatively few methods exist that incorporate epigenetic information or allow for statistical hypothesis testing. This Genome Canada funded project is a collaboration with Dr. Mathieu Blanchette and Dr. Jerome Waldispuhl. Among its aims are the implementation of a Virtual Reality based 3D epigenome browser, development of robust statistics for 3D epigenome analysis, and application of those methods to the analysis of real data.

Those include mutations in SNRPB, which cause Cerebrocostomandibular syndrome, mutations in EFTUD2 causing Mandibulofacial dysostosis, and mutation in SF3B4 causing Nager Syndrome. We are following up on figuring out how mutations in constitutively expressed spliceosomal proteins result in such specific developmental phenotypes. This work is funded by CIHR in collaboration with Dr. Jerome-Majewska. We are using CRISPR genome editing to introduce the mutation in mouse models we study their consequences using both classical and genomic approaches, with the focus of our group being on RNA seq analysis and categorizing the changes to splicing patterns in mutant animals.

She is Quebec native -from Gaspesie- and trained to become a Lab Technician in 1995. She then continued her education in microbiology and did a MSc in Philippe Gros lab at McGill in 2002. She brought all her diverse lab experience to the Majewski lab, which included only bioinformaticians at the time. Partly present in the lab to prepare samples, CRISPR cells or to train the new students, she can also be found in the offices coordinating sequencing submissions and shipments for our collaborators, writing protocols, analyzing sequences and learning more bioinformatics.

            <p class="paragraph paragraph-13"><span class="paragraph-text-18">Lucy is a PhD student in the Majewski lab and an RNA enthusiast. She graduated from McMaster University with a master's degree in Biology. Coming from a plant genomics and transcriptomics background, she's now interested in the expression of non-coding RNA species in the vast intergenic regions that are differentially regulated by aberrant methylation in cancer. Lucy plans to explore this using computational methods and machine learning. Her hobbies are hiking, Japanese mahjong, piano and playing video games.</span>

Despite enjoying these past research domains, which combined both wet and dry lab work, he realized that his passion lies in data analysis. For his PhD project, he will be using bioinformatic approaches to elucidate the connection between epigenetic defects, promiscuous transcription and immune response. In his free time, he enjoys long-distance running (5-10km), weightlifting (the big 3 – squat, deadlift and bench) and other sports, like tennis and basketball. Fun fact: his name is a palindrome!</span>

He participates in all of the scientific or social activities from both groups. Ashot studied medicine in Armenia and afterwards completed his doctoral studies in Vienna, Austria, at the Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM), working on genetics of myeloproliferative neoplasms. After obtaining his PhD degree, he moved to the Jabado lab as a postdoctoral fellow until November 2018, after which he transitioned to the position of research associate. Ashot’s work in the lab is focused on the characterization of epigenomic changes in pediatric glioblastoma. Utilizing modern genome editing techniques and high throughput sequencing technologies, he is trying to understand how the driver mutations in glioblastoma change epigenomic landscape in tumor cells and lead to the development of cancer. Outside of work, Ashot likes to read science fiction, and he is a fan of watching and playing various sports (soccer, basketball, tennis, etc.). He is also a competitive bridge player.</span>

Prior to her degree in Human Genetics, Octavia obtained a BSc in Biochemistry (minor in Biotechnology) from McGill University, during which time she performed research as an undergraduate research assistant in the Majewski lab for 2 years. Her current primary research project is a bioinformatics-based investigation focused on identifying and characterizing the drivers of global DNA hypomethylation in Head &amp; Neck Cancers and the transcriptional aberrations that result from that epigenetically-disturbed landscape, and the downstream effects of these cryptic transcripts. She is passionate about problem-solving and aims to convert the findings of her research on transcriptional aberrations in globally DNA hypomethylated tumors into clinically-actionable, targeted therapeutic strategies. In addition to her research, Octavia is involved in promoting innovation within the epigenetic and scientific communities, through the coordination of multiple event series dedicated to encouraging discussion across researchers of different disciplines and backgrounds, as well as stimulating dialogue on the intersection of science, ethics and policymaking.</span>
