        <h3>Oncohistones, et al</h3>
        <p>Several years ago, our group was involved in identifying mutations in histone genes, H3K27M and H3G34R, as frequent driver lesions in pediatric glioblastoma. Later, we found H3K36M mutations in sarcomas and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Mutation in histone genes have also been found in leukemias and bone tumors. Since those original discoveries, we have been using whole genome approaches to understand the molecular pathways through which “oncohistones” participate in carcinogenesis. This project is an international collaboration funded by the NIH, along with the labs of Dr. David Allis (Rockefeller, NY), Dr. Tom Muir (Princeton, NJ), Dr. Ben Garcia (UPenn, PA), Dr. Peter Lewis (Madison), and Dr. Nada Jabado (McGill). Our group focuses on the application of epigenome profiling techniques, such as ChIP seq and WGBS to identify epigenetic aberrations and RNA sequencing to connect them with their downstream transcriptomic consequences. <br>More details at <a href="http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/P01-CA196539-04-7967">http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/P01-CA196539-04-7967</a></p>

        <h3>Epigenetics of Paediatric Brain Tumors</h3>
        <p>While rare, paediatric brain tumors are extremely deadly. Along with our collaborators, we have shown that the molecular mechanisms driving paediatric tumors are generally distinct from those underlying their adult equivalents. Most oncohistone mutations are unique to childhood cancers. The C19MC micro RNA cluster fusion is the unique driver of embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes. Ependymomas and medulloblastomas have their own sets of specific driver mutations, and they often affect the epigenome. This project, funded by Genome Canada and CIHR is a collaboration with Dr. Michael Taylor’s lab (Sick Kids, Toronto), Dr. Nada Jabado’s lab (McGill) and many bioinformatics and genomics experts across Canada. The project also contains drug development, ethics, health economics subcomponents. Our group is particularly interested in the dependencies between different epigenetic modifications, particularly those occurring at the H3K36 and H3K27 residues, and DNA methylation. We use genomics and analytical approaches in cell lines and mouse models to elucidate those interrelationships. <br>More details at <a href="">here</a></p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 callout"> 
        <h3>3D epigenomics</h3>
        <p>This project aims to bridge the gaps between the 1D and 3D genomic paradigms. Since the release of the first contiguous DNA genomic DNA sequences, towards the end of the last millennium, the ever-growing genomics community has largely considered the genome as a series of linear, 1-dimensional strings. As our knowledge and technologies mature, we are becoming increasingly aware that DNA is not a simple double stranded molecule, it is wrapped around a nucleosome core whose modifications impose specific flavours to its properties, and finally that this chromatin structure has a spatial, 3-dimensional component which further determines, or perhaps reflects the underlying molecular processes. In the recent years, this spatial paradigm has been brought to light by technologies such as Hi-C, which allow us to profile genome-wide patterns in chromatin architecture. While many “epigenomicists” are aware of the progress in the 3D field and are eager to incorporate this information in their work, it is not trivial to make a transition from the classical, 1D way of thinking to the 3D world.

On the chromatin conformation side, while some methodological approaches have been accepted by the community, relatively few methods exist that incorporate epigenetic information or allow for statistical hypothesis testing. This Genome Canada funded project is a collaboration with Dr. Mathieu Blanchette and Dr. Jerome Waldispuhl. Among its aims are the implementation of a Virtual Reality based 3D epigenome browser, development of robust statistics for 3D epigenome analysis, and application of those methods to the analysis of real data.<br>More details at <a href=""> insert website here </a> </p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 callout"> 
        <h3>Alternative splicing</h3>
        <p>Our earlier work on applications of exome and genome sequencing to elucidate the genetic causes of rare disease has identified several disorders caused by mutations in components of the spliceosome. Those include mutations in SNRPB, which cause Cerebrocostomandibular syndrome, mutations in EFTUD2 causing Mandibulofacial dysostosis, and mutation in SF3B4 causing Nager Syndrome. We are following up on figuring out how mutations in constitutively expressed spliceosomal proteins result in such specific developmental phenotypes. This work is funded by CIHR in collaboration with Dr. Jerome-Majewska. We are using CRISPR genome editing to introduce the mutation in mouse models we study their consequences using both classical and genomic approaches, with the focus of our group being on RNA seq analysis and categorizing the changes to splicing patterns in mutant animals.

        <h3>CARE for RARE</h3>
        <p>CARE for RARE is a pan-Canadian collaborative team of clinicians, bioinformaticians, scientists and researchers 
        building upon the infrastructure and discoveries of the FORGE Canada (Finding of Rare Disease Genes) project.  
        The goal of CARE for RARE is to improve clinical care for patients and families affected by rare diseases.  
        This will be done by expanding and improving the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. <br>More details at <a href="http://care4rare.ca/">http://care4rare.ca</a></p>

        <h3>Biomarkers for paediatric glioblastoma through genomics and epigenomics</h3>
        <p>We contributed in establishing the ICHANGE consortium that groups samples and expertise across the world, and helped revolutionize our 
understanding of HGA in children. Our major aim is
to develop and validate diagnostic tests of H3.3 mutations in HGA.<br>More details at <a href="http://ichangeconsortium.mcgill.ca/">http://ichangeconsortium.mcgill.ca</a> </p>

        <h3>TNBC: Resistance to chemotherapy</h3>
        <p>Although we understand the differences between tumour cells and normal cells, 
so much so that we can target these differences, metastatic tumours, 
including those resistant to therapy, are less known because it is much harder to obtain samples from those sites. 
Our aim is to obtain biopsies before treatment with the most powerful 
drugs in breast cancer, and after the treatment, to then identify the molecular factors of resistance to treatment.
